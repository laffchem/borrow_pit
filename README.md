These maps were created with orthomosaics from a drone to model the amount of dirt removed from March to September of 2023. This was done to ensure it was following specifications in the original plans submitted to the city. The model was calculated in meters, then converted to cubic yards of surface volume difference to be given to city engineers for comparison.
